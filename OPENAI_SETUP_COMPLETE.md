## Adding AI to Other Pages

### Example: Add AI Analysis to Crypto Page

```typescript
// src/app/crypto/page.tsx
import { getOpenAIService } from '@/lib/services/openai-service';

const analyzeCrypto = async (symbol: string) => {
  const service = getOpenAIService();
  const signal = await service.analyzeStock(
    symbol,
    currentPrice,
    change,
    volume
  );

  // Display signal to user
};
```

### Example: Add Strategy to Settings

```typescript
// src/app/settings/page.tsx
const generatePersonalStrategy = async () => {
  const service = getOpenAIService();
  const strategy = await service.generateStrategy(
    userGoals,
    userRiskTolerance,
    userCapital,
    userAssets
  );

  // Save to user profile
};
```

2. Add variable:
   - **Key:** `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - **Value:** `your-openai-api-key-here` (the key starting with sk-proj-)
3. Click "Save"

### Step 2: Deploy

Commit and push changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add OpenAI-powered AI agents"

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "OpenAI API key not provided"
**Solution:** Make sure `.env.local` has `OPENAI_API_KEY`

### Error: "Rate limit exceeded"
**Solution:**
- Free tier: 3 requests/minute
- Wait a minute and try again
- Or upgrade to paid tier

### Error: "Insufficient quota"
**Solution:**
- Add credits: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
- Need at least $5 to start

### AI gives generic responses
**Solution:**
