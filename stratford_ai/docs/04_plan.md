# Planning Checklist – Stratford AI

## Before AI Coding
- [x] Annotated screenshots prepared
- [x] Research notes completed
- [x] Architecture doc reviewed
- [x] PRD drafted

## Planning Phase
Ask AI:
> "Read the PRD, research, and architecture doc. Create a step-by-step plan to implement Stratford AI Core Engine in the existing codebase. Do not code yet."

- [ ] Review AI-generated plan
- [ ] Clarify unclear steps
- [ ] Break large items into smaller PRDs

## Coding Phase
- [ ] Implement step-by-step (never whole plan at once)
- [ ] Test immediately after each step
- [ ] Provide feedback in small chunks

✅ Guardrail: Prevent AI from skipping steps or overbuilding.
