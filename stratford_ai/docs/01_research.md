# Stratford AI - Research & Problem Analysis

## Project Overview
**Stratford AI** is a private AI wealth engine designed to exploit inefficiencies in probabilistic systems and financial markets for solo operators.

## Problem Statement

### Core Problem
Individual traders and investors lack access to institutional-grade AI trading systems that can:
- Process multiple data streams simultaneously
- Run reproducible, backtested strategies
- Provide actionable insights without requiring large teams or capital

### Market Inefficiencies Targeted
1. **Latency gaps** in retail vs institutional data access
2. **Pattern recognition** in market movements using ML
3. **Risk-adjusted returns** through systematic backtesting
4. **Solo operator constraints** - need for self-contained, auditable systems

## Target User Profile

**Primary User: Jay (Solo Operator)**
- Technical background, can run local applications
- Seeks edge in financial markets without external capital
- Values deterministic, reproducible results
- Needs auditable performance metrics
- Prefers self-hosted solutions for privacy/control

## Key Observations

### Technical Requirements
- **Deterministic outputs**: Same inputs must produce same results
- **Data sovereignty**: Local processing, no cloud dependencies for core logic
- **Auditability**: All decisions must be traceable and explainable
- **Performance**: Real-time data processing with historical backtesting

### Competitive Landscape
- Institutional platforms (Bloomberg Terminal, QuantConnect) - too expensive/complex
- Retail platforms (TradingView, MetaTrader) - limited customization
- Open source solutions - fragmented, require significant setup

### Success Metrics
- **Reproducibility**: 100% deterministic outputs given same seed
- **Performance**: Sharpe ratio > 1.0 on backtested strategies
- **Usability**: Setup and run first strategy in < 30 minutes
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for data ingestion and processing

## Data Sources Identified

### Primary (MVP)
- **Yahoo Finance API**: Free, reliable for basic OHLCV data
- **Alpha Vantage**: API key required, good for fundamental data
- **CSV datasets**: Historical data for offline testing

### Secondary (Future)
- Real-time news feeds
- Options chains and derivatives
- Alternative data (social sentiment, satellite imagery)

## Technology Stack Rationale

### Frontend: Next.js 14 + TypeScript
- Server-side rendering for performance
- Type safety for financial calculations
- Rich ecosystem for data visualization

### Backend: Node.js + Express
- Consistent JavaScript ecosystem
- Excellent package ecosystem for financial libraries
- Easy deployment and scaling

### Database: SQLite (MVP) â†’ PostgreSQL (Production)
- Local storage for privacy
- ACID compliance for financial data
- Easy migration path to PostgreSQL

### Testing: Vitest + Playwright
- Fast unit testing with Vitest
- End-to-end testing for critical user flows
- Deterministic test execution

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Data quality**: API downtime or data inconsistencies
- **Model drift**: Strategies may degrade over time
- **Performance**: Large datasets may require optimization

### Business Risks
- **Regulatory**: Financial data usage compliance
- **Market risk**: Backtested performance â‰  future results
- **Competition**: Institutional players with more resources

### Mitigation Strategies
- Multiple data source fallbacks
- Comprehensive backtesting with out-of-sample validation
- Clear disclaimers about past performance
- Focus on methodology over absolute returns

## Next Steps
1. Architecture design with deterministic principles
2. MVP feature prioritization
3. Development roadmap with testable milestones
4. Risk management framework implementation
