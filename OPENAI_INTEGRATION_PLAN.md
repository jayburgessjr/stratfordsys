## Features to Build with OpenAI

### 1. **AI Trading Agents** ü§ñ
**What it does:**
- Analyzes market data and generates trading recommendations
- Monitors positions and suggests when to buy/sell
- Explains reasoning behind each recommendation
- Learns from market patterns

**Example:**
```
Agent: "Market Analyzer"
Input: Current SPY price, volume, RSI, MACD
Output: "BUY signal with 87% confidence. RSI shows oversold conditions
and MACD golden cross forming. Target: $450, Stop loss: $440"
```

### 2. **Strategy Generator** üìä
**What it does:**
- Generate custom trading strategies based on your goals
- Optimize parameters for existing strategies
- Explain strategy logic in plain English
- Suggest improvements to underperforming strategies

**Example:**
```
User: "Create a strategy for volatile tech stocks"
AI: "I recommend a Bollinger Bands Breakout strategy:
- Buy when price breaks above upper band with high volume
- Sell when price touches middle band
- Use 2% stop loss
- Best for stocks with IV > 40%"
```

### 3. **Lottery Number Analysis** üé∞
**What it does:**
- Analyze historical lottery patterns
- Generate numbers based on statistical trends
- Explain probability and expected value
- Suggest when jackpots are worth playing

**Example:**
```
Input: Last 100 Powerball drawings
Output: "Based on frequency analysis, numbers 7, 14, 21 are 'hot'.
However, lottery is -EV. If you must play, these numbers have
appeared 23% more than average in the last 6 months."
```

### 4. **Sports Betting Analysis** üèà
**What it does:**
- Analyze team statistics and game matchups
- Identify value bets and arbitrage opportunities
- Calculate expected value of each bet
- Explain reasoning for recommendations

**Example:**
```
Game: Lakers vs Warriors
Analysis: "Lakers favored by 5.5 points. Warriors have covered
spread in 7 of last 10 road games. Lakers missing key player.
Recommendation: Warriors +5.5 with 68% confidence."
```

### 5. **Market News Sentiment** üì∞
**What it does:**

sales and differentiate from competitors. Analyst price targets
likely to increase."
```

- Analyze your portfolio allocation
- Suggest rebalancing opportunities
- Identify risk concentrations
- Recommend diversification strategies

**Example:**
```
Portfolio: 60% tech stocks, 30% crypto, 10% cash

declining on up-moves, suggesting weakening momentum."
```

export class OpenAIService {
  private client: OpenAI;

  constructor(apiKey: string) {
    this.client = new OpenAI({ apiKey });
  }

  async analyzeMarket(data: MarketData) {
    // Use GPT-4 to analyze market conditions

    // Generate trading strategy
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: AI Trading Agents (Week 1)

                   4) Target price and stop loss`
      }
    ],
    temperature: 0.3, // Lower = more consistent

## Cost Estimation

### OpenAI Pricing (GPT-4)
- **Input:** $0.03 per 1K tokens (~750 words)
- **Output:** $0.06 per 1K tokens

### Typical Usage:
- **Market analysis:** ~500 tokens = $0.03 per analysis
- **Strategy generation:** ~1000 tokens = $0.09 per strategy
- **Chat responses:** ~300 tokens = $0.02 per message

### Monthly Cost Estimates:

**Light Usage (100 requests/day):**
- 100 market analyses/day √ó 30 days = $90/month
- Great for learning and testing

**Medium Usage (500 requests/day):**
- 500 analyses/day √ó 30 days = $450/month
- Suitable for active trading

**Heavy Usage (2000 requests/day):**
- 2000 analyses/day √ó 30 days = $1,800/month
- For professional/automated trading

### Cost Optimization:
- Use GPT-3.5-Turbo for simple tasks (10x cheaper)
- Cache responses for 5-15 minutes
- Batch similar requests
- Use streaming for long responses

## Safety & Risk Management

### Important Guardrails:

   - Show historical accuracy
   - Remind about risk management

3. **Position Sizing**
   - AI suggests max 2% risk per trade
   - Never recommend all-in positions
   - Account for correlation risk

4. **Gambling Features**
   - Always show negative expected value
   - Emphasize entertainment only
   - Suggest spending limits

5. **Rate Limiting**
   - Cache AI responses
   - Limit requests per user
   - Prevent API abuse
