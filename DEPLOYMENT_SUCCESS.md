## ✅ What's Working

Your Stratford AI app is now live with:

### Real Market Data Setup

- ✅ **Widget added** to dashboard

---

## 🔍 Verify Real Data Widget

**Visit your site:** https://stratfordsys.netlify.app/

**Look for the "Real Market Data" widget** at the top of the dashboard. It should show:

### If Working Correctly:
- 🟢 **Green WiFi icon** - "Real Market Data - Live"
- **Real prices** for SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT
- **Change indicators** (green ↑ or red ↓)
- **Last updated** timestamp
- **Refresh button** that works

### If You See Issues:
- 🔴 **Red WiFi icon** - "Disconnected" or "Connection failed"
- **Mock data** instead of real prices
- **Error messages** in the widget

---

## Troubleshooting (If Real Data Not Working)

### Option 1: Check Browser Console
1. Press **F12** on the site
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for errors related to:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY`
   - `fetch` errors to alphavantage.co
   - Rate limit messages

### Option 2: Verify Environment Variable
1. Go to Netlify: https://app.netlify.com/sites/stratfordsys/configuration/env
2. Confirm variable exists: `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY`
3. Value should be: `26SZR0LE05TXVNG6`
4. If missing or wrong, fix it and redeploy

### Option 3: Clear Cache and Redeploy
1. Netlify dashboard → **Deploys** tab
2. Click **"Trigger deploy"** → **"Clear cache and deploy site"**
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for rebuild

### Option 4: Check Market Hours
- Stock prices only update during market hours: **9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET (Mon-Fri)**
- Outside market hours, you'll see the last closing prices
- If trying on weekend/evening, this is normal!

## 📊 What Data You're Seeing

### Currently:
- **Mock/Simulated data** for most of the dashboard (portfolio, performance, charts)
- **Real market data** for the new widget (if API key is working)

### Why Both?
- Most features still use simulated data (by design)
- Real data widget is your **first step** toward real trading
- You can gradually replace mock data with real data in other components
