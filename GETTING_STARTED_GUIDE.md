# Getting Started Guide: Building Real Wealth with Stratford AI

**Goal:** Transform this application from a demo into a real wealth-building tool

---

## What You Have Now ‚úÖ

Your Stratford AI application is a **fully functional demo** with:
- Beautiful UI with all pages working
- Navigation system complete
- Mock/simulated data for all features
- Solid architecture and code structure
- No bugs or crashes

**But it's all simulation - not connected to real markets.**

---

## What You're Missing to Build Real Wealth

### 1. **Real Market Data** üíπ

**Current Status:** All prices and charts are simulated/fake

**What You Need:**

- Or Polygon.io API key
- Or IEX Cloud API key

**Why You Need This:**
- See actual stock prices
- Get real cryptocurrency data
- Track real market movements
- Make decisions based on real information

**Cost:** FREE (with limitations) or $10-50/month for better data

---

### 2. **Real Trading Execution** üí∞

**Current Status:** All "Trade" and "Execute" buttons don't do anything

**What You Need to Choose:**

#### Option A: Stock Trading
**Broker APIs to integrate:**
- **Alpaca** (Free, commission-free stock/crypto trading)
  - Get API key at: https://alpaca.markets
  - Paper trading (fake money) included for testing
  - Live trading requires funding account
  - Minimum: $0 for paper, varies for live

- **Interactive Brokers** (Professional trading)

**Cost:** $0 to create account, but you need capital to trade (minimum $10-100 depending on platform)

---

### 3. **Trading Strategy Implementation** üß†

**Current Status:** The app shows signals and recommendations, but doesn't execute them

**What You Need to Build:**

#### A. Automated Trading Bot
```typescript
// Example: Auto-execute high-confidence signals
if (signal.confidence > 85 && signal.action === 'BUY') {
  await executeTrade({
    symbol: signal.symbol,
    side: 'buy',
    quantity: calculatePositionSize(signal),
    type: 'market'
  });
}
```

#### B. Risk Management System
- Set maximum position sizes
- Implement stop-losses
- Define daily loss limits
- Set maximum trades per day

#### C. Backtesting Before Live Trading
- Test strategies on historical data
- Verify profitability before risking real money
- Optimize parameters

**Investment Needed:** Time to build or $50-200/month for strategy platform subscriptions

---

### 4. **Capital to Trade With** üíµ

**Current Status:** No real money connected

**What You Need:**
- **For Learning/Testing:** $0 - Use paper trading (simulated money)
- **For Small Real Trading:** $100-1,000 - Start small, learn
- **For Serious Trading:** $5,000-10,000 - Meaningful position sizes
- **For Full-Time Trading:** $25,000+ - Pattern day trader requirement (US stocks)

**Recommendation:** Start with paper trading (fake money) for 3-6 months before risking real capital.
